  annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p> The examples found in this package are meant for testing, validating, and analysing the simulation output the WECC-based PV model against experimental data from the 
ALSETLab Volta Facility. The examples tries to recreate the inverter's response to a terminal voltage variance by replaying the experimental voltage variation and analyzing 
the the output response of the inverter model against the experimental data. The inverter in the experiment is set to volt-var mode.
